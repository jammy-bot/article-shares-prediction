# Module 3 Final Project


## The Project

The main goal of this project is to create a classification model.

...

### b. Selecting a Data Set _Outside_ of the Curated List

...


## The Deliverables

For online students, your completed project should contain the following four deliverables:

1. A **_Jupyter Notebook_** containing any code you've written for this project. This work will need to be pushed to a public GitHub repository dedicated for this project.

2. An organized **README.md** file in the GitHub repository that describes the contents of the repository. This file should be the source of information for navigating through the repository. 

3. A **_Blog Post_**.

4. An **_"Executive Summary" PowerPoint Presentation_** that gives a brief overview of your problem/dataset, and each step of the OSEMN process.

### Jupyter Notebook Must-Haves

* The notebook is written to technical audiences with a way to both understand your approach and reproduce your results. 

**_Process, Methodology, and Findings_**

* Your notebook should contain a clear record of your process and methodology for exploring and preprocessing your data, building and tuning a model, and interpreting your results.

### Blog Post Must-Haves

Refer back to the [Blogging Guidelines](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-welcome-blogging-v2-1) for the technical requirements and blog ideas.

## The Process

These steps are informed by Smart Vision's<sup>1</sup> description of the CRISP-DM process.

### 1. Business Understanding

...

### 2. Data Understanding

Instructions to download and explore

Subsetting relevant data?

What kind of data cleaning is required?

...visualizations of the data

### 3. Data Preparation

document any data that you choose to drop or otherwise exclude

feature scaling

### 4. Modeling

testing the model on unseen data

cross-validation, and regularization

sort of model ... logistic regression, decision trees, bagging, boosting, ...

### 5. Evaluation

different metrics

... accuracy...perhaps it is more important to minimize false positives, or false negatives. It might therefore be more appropriate to focus on precision or recall. You might also calculate the AUC-ROC to measure your model's *discrimination*.

### 6. Deployment
